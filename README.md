# Steph-s-Tech-Blog

In this assignment, I created a blog program where a user can view blogs without being logged in, but must be logged in to create, modify, and delete blogs. The user can view their blog dashboard and create new blogs, modify existing blogs, and delete current blogs. Some struggles I had in this project were being able to add comment functionality and being able to add different users that can create profiles.
